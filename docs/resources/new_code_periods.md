## Schema

### Required

- `type` (String) The kind of new code period to use. Supported values are SPECIFIC_ANALYSIS, PREVIOUS_VERSION, NUMBER_OF_DAYS, or REFERENCE_BRANCH.

### Optional

- `branch` (String) The name of a branch of a project for which the new code period will be configured. Changing this will force a new resource to be created. Setting this also requires setting the 'project' argument.
- `project` (String) The key of a project for which the new code period will be configured. Changing this will force a new resource to be created.
- `value` (String) The desired value of the new code period. Varies based on the 'type'. For SPECIFIC_ANALYIS, the value must be the UUID of a previous analysis. For NUMBER_OF_DAYS it must be a numeric string. For REFERENCE_BRANCH it should be the name of branch on the project. For PREVIOUS_VERSION it must **not** be set.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
